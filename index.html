      <h3>About Alicia</h3>
      <p>Born in San Mateo, California, I moved up to Washigton State in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade with my family after my Dad got a job with Microsoft (like many other families in the area). I attended Bellevue High School, and went on the get my Bachelors of Arts degree in Psychology from Scripps College.</p>
      <p>As an undergraduate, I balanced school with work and activities ranging from board game club to ultimate frisbee. In 2016 I took a Social Psychology class, leading to an opportunity for publication. During the class, my fellow students and I wrote short essays about social pyschology topics, accumulated in a now-published book "Social Psychology and World Peace: A Primer".</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2015, I was hired as a Summer Marketing Intern at Oracle. This experience was crucial in developing my interest in tech, and also opened my eyes to Marketing as a career. When I graduated Scripps in 2017, I began full-time at Oracle as part of the Class Of Marketing.</p>
      <p>When not working, I enjoy playing Bridge, Quidditch, and hanging out with friends.</p>
